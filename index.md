# What is Voices of the Court?

Voices of the Court is a Crusader kings 3 mod that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into the gameplay. It lets you hold conversations with the characters and also impact the game state to an extend.

## How does it work?

The mod extracts the necessary game information from ck3, converts them into prompts for the llms and and creates a chat for you with the selected character. 

## How does it impact the game state?

We impact the game with **Actions**. These are predefined game effects that gets triggered when the llm thinks it should. Only the predefined actions will get triggered, the llm can't make these actions on their own.
