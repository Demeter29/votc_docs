# Common Errors

### The background scene doesn't appear. / The actions are not triggered in-game

This is caused by playing in Ironman mode. The mod is unfortunately not compatible with ironman saves because it uses console commands.

### The chat window doesn't appear when starting a conversation.

This means your CK3 user folder path is not set up correctly, or the application is not running in the backgroun.

### "Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day"

This means you used up your free models credit on Openrouter. You will either need to wait for tomorrow, or upload credit and use a paid model.
