# Common Errors

**The background scene doesn't appear. / The actions are not triggered in-game**

This is caused by playing in Ironman mode. The mod is unfortunately not compatible with ironman saves because it uses console commands.

**"Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day"**

This means you used up your free models credit on Openrouter. You will either need to wait for tomorrow, or upload credit and use a paid model.
